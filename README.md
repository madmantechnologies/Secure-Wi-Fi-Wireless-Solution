# Secure-Wi-Fi-Wireless-Solution
Many smart devices in our homes have not been developed with security in mind. Cyber-attacks can affect every gadget we use that is connected to the internet. A virus can infect your entire network by attaching any unprotected device to it. As a result, secure Wi-Fi technology is essential. The objective of Wi-Fi security is to keep devices and networks connected to a wireless network safe. With Wi-Fi that automatically monitors for online dangers and allows you to choose which devices connect to the network, you can keep your house safe. You can inspect, manage, and control your network's devices using the Secure Wi-Fi dashboard. Anyone with a computer or mobile device within range of a router's wireless signal is unable to access a network device such as a router or wireless access point thanks to Wi-Fi security. We must now understand how to protect our Wi-Fi network. To encrypt our network, change your router's security settings to WPA3 Personal or WPA2 Personal. Passwords are pre-configured on some routers. These passwords, however, are easily discovered by hackers, thus they should be changed to something more complicated. If you want to make your network more secure, changing the default password is a good idea. Contact Madman Technologies Pvt Ltd to ensure a safe and smooth Wi-Fi experience.
